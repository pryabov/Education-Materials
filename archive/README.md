This repository contains several examples of trivial architecture approaches which can be used in application development. Nothing special, but it can be helpful at the beginning.

## .NET Core 3.1
- `trivial-architecture-core` console application example
- `trivial-architecture-core-v2` console application example, main difference from the previous one that inside it used `IHostBuilder`.

## .NET Framework
- `trivial-architecture-framework` console application example based on .NET Framework
- `trivial-mvc-architecture-framework` mvc applicaiton based on .NET Framework
